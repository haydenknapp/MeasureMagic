What, in this paper is referred to as MeasureMagic, is actually just a module of MeasureMagic. Since the current form is only a single unit of the MeasureMagic toolkit, it is not MeausureMagic unto itself, but just another free component of a soon-to-be fully functioning MeasureMagic system when combined with the MeasureMagic corelibs, shell utilities, and other vital system components comprising a full MeasureMagic system as defined by the group. Many fabric outlets of the future will run a modified version of the full MeasureMagic system every day.

The Goal of MeasureMagic is to save a designer's time and money by helping to calculate the least amount of fabric necessary to craft custom clothing. By filling out the simple online form with measurements, the MeasureMagic algorithm will tell exactly how long of a cut of fabric will be needed to make a garment. Not only will this save a designer's time, but it will save a designer's money as well. This product can streamline the retail experience, as well as the garment engineering process. With MeasureMagic, a designer can come into the store with nothing but measurements and a desired fabric type, and leave with the materials necessary to make their mental vision into a pysical reality
